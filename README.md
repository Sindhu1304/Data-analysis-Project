# Company Data Analysis & Visualization
## Project Overview
# This project involves analyzing data from six different datasets, which initially contained missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries. To extract meaningful insights, I:

Merged the datasets using Company Name and other relevant identifiers to create a consolidated dataset.
Cleaned the merged data by handling missing values, removing duplicate rows/columns, and ensuring data consistency.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
Created data visualizations using Python and built an interactive report in Power BI for better insights.
# Data Cleaning & Processing
Used Pandas to read, merge, and manipulate datasets efficiently.
Handled missing values by imputation or removal, depending on the context.
Removed duplicate columns and redundant data to optimize dataset structure.
Performed feature extraction to generate new insights from the existing attributes.
Used NumPy for numerical computations such as mean, aggregation, and statistical measures.
Data Analysis & Visualizations
I created multiple visualizations to explore and interpret key aspects of the dataset:

# Python-Based Visualizations (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
Industry-wise Employee Distribution: Analyzed the total number of employees across industries using bar charts.
Company Growth Analysis: Explored company size and growth trends based on employee count and revenue.
Funding Trends: Visualized funding distribution among companies.
Revenue vs. Employee Count: Created scatter plots to identify trends between revenue and workforce size.
# Power BI Dashboard
Top Companies by Employee Count: Displayed the largest companies based on workforce size.
Industry-wise Employee Distribution: Visualized the number of employees in different industries.
Company Growth Over the Years: Showed how employee numbers changed over time.
Annual Revenue Distribution: Created a breakdown of company revenues.
Funding Insights: Highlighted investment trends in various sectors.
# Technologies & Libraries Used
